Tree Facts

If there are 'n' number of nodes in complete binary tree, then the height of the tree = log n
Log is taken to the base of 2
e.g., n = 5, height = 2
      n = 13, height = 3
      
If the height of the tree is nm then there are maximum 2^(n+1) - 1 nodes in the tree

If binary tree is stored in array representation (BFS or level wise), starting from index 1 to n then:
child of element at index n is at : (2*n) and (2*n + 1)
